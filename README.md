This is Shreyas, a passionate software developer who thrives on pushing the boundaries of my capabilities. With a deep commitment to growth and excellence, I constantly seek to challenge myself and explore new frontiers in software engineering.

I am currently working on a project called [Xenode](https://github.com/XenodeStudio/Xenode) which is a general purpose 2D and 3D game engine. The source code of Xenode is hosted in GitHub as a seperate organization 
[Xenode Studio](https://github.com/XenodeStudio) where the project is actively developed and maintained. While the project is in development, The game engine is built with flexibility and performance in mind.
Through this initiative, I am continually enhancing my skills and contributing to the creation of a robust, open-source game development platform.
